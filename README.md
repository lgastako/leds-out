# leds-out

A reimagining of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(game) in Clojure
using overtone to harness the Novatio Launchpad S as a UI.

This depends on my [launchtone](http://github.com/lgastako/launchtone) library.
Both the launchtone library and the game itself are brand new so expect bugs.
